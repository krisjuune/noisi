- write a function that generates a random source phase spectrum or time series (time series can be without amplitude information)

- (Maybe: include a spatial correlation length to the previous function)

- write a function that calls the random source-generating function, and uses it to build up time series of noise at a station

- write a script that gets time series of noise at two stations; then get their correlation

- fit everything into noisi by updating calls from main, config files and config file comments
